# iris_flower_dataset_ml_project
â€œThis project leverages Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to build and evaluate a classification model on the Iris flower dataset. It focuses on using PCA for dimensionality reduction to predict Iris flower species based on their features. Includes data exploration, PCA-based model training, and performance evaluation.
## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can then install the required packages using `pip`.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rajeev-gaur/iris_flower_dataset_ml_project.git
    cd iris-dataset-project
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage

To run the analysis and generate visualizations, execute the `iris_flower_dataset_ML.py` script and 'iris_visuallisation.py' scripts respectively.

```bash
python iris_flower_dataset_ML.py
python iris_visualisation.py 

The Iris dataset used in this project is included with the `sklearn` library. It consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 features for each sample:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)

The dataset includes three species of iris:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica
